// Ths below note is from a previous workshop:

// The purpose of this module is to bring your Sequelize instance (`db`) together
// with your models (which you should define in separate modules in this directory).
// Example:
//
// const Puppy = require('./puppy')
// const Owner = require('./owner')

// After you've required all of your models into this module, you should establish
// associations (https://sequelize-guides.netlify.com/association-types/) between them here as well!
// Example:
//
// Puppy.belongsTo(Owner)

const db = require('./database');
const User = require('./models/User');

module.exports = db;
